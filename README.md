rust-redex
==========

This repo contains an encoding of Patina using Redex.

This redex model is taken from the formal model specified by Niko Matsakis
in his PLDI submission.

STATUS as of 2013-01-25: super-preliminary. The grammar of the program
terms is there, but none of the type checker or the evaluation rules.
